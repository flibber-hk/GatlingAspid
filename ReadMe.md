# Gatling Aspid

A mod that makes primal aspids wield miniguns and optionally shoot crystals and ooma cores.

To turn on crystal projectiles, open up the Gatling Aspid global settings file `GatlingAspid.GlobalSettings.json` in the Hollow Knight saves directory and change `Crystals` to `true`.

To turn on grenades, set `Grenades` to `true`.

Aspid health can also be tuned using `AspidHP`.
